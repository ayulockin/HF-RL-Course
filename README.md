# HF-RL-Course
My exploration and exploitation of HF-RL-Course!

HuggingFace launched their [Deep Reinforcement Learning Course](https://huggingface.co/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction?fw=pt) on Dec 5th, 2022. I have always wanted to master this discipline of Deep Learning and I think now is the chance. I am also learning about Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback to discove the inner workings of InstructGPT and it's successor ChatGPT.

This repository will be used by me to make progress each day to learn more about it. This repo will mostly be used to beat [The Deep Reinforcement Learning Course Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Leaderboard). Let's see how well I do.

I will be using the course code and turning them into scripts. I will instrument them with [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) because I use this for all experiment tracking and model versioning related stuff. 

Feeling inspired! Fork this repo and make your own progress public.
